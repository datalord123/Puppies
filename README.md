# Puppies

I need help optimizing the schema so that all the cascades and constraints are done appropriately. Also structure.

For the query script. The main issue I would like help with is how to do the left join so the output shows up the way I want it to, see 
comments in the file for more info.

There are some other minor comments including one sql.alchemy.instance error on the 
check_occupancy("Oakland Animal Services")
function.

But that's about it. If Rahul ever ends up reviewing it, please let me know.
Thanks
